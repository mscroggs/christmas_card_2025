{\footnotesize
\begin{enumerlist}[10mm]
\item[1.] There are only a few odd numbers to add up.
\item[2.] What is the sum of the odd integers between 0 and 2? Between 0 and 4? 0 and 6? What's the pattern?
\item[3.] Try some numbers of baubles between 2 and 20.
\item[4.] What would be the answer for 2 or 3 people? Or 2 or 3 or 4 people? Can you generalise?
\item[5.] It's not too much bigger than 100.
\item[6.] How many one-digit integers? How many two-digit integers? How many three-digit integers? {\dots} What's the most digits the number could have?
\item[7.] If you find four numbers in a row that you can make, you could make all larger scores by adding some 4s.
\item[8.] Try it with a few smaller numbers and look for a pattern.
\item[9.] $10=1+2+3+4$, $11=5+6$, $12=3+4+5$. Keep going until there's one you can't do.
\item[10.] What's special about numbers that are the sum of four consecutive integers?
\item[11.] Try it with 3 points, 4 points, 5 points, and look for a pattern.
\item[12.] Use your pattern from 11.

\item Solve the puzzles below.
\item For every pair of digits that appears in each answer, colour the two squares on the front
    cover that contain the pair. For example, if an answer in the green section was
    3305, you would colour the squares containing 33, 30 and 05 green.
